At the time, I wasn&#x27;t sure\nwhat I wanted to make, so I settled to create this portfolio website.</p>\n<p>However, I didn&#x27;t want to make a simple single page portfolio, that was something I could do in like a day if you just gave me React and TailwindCSS.</p>\n<p>So I decided that this portfolio website would also host blog posts.</p>\n<p>I had put a lot of thought into what I wanted for a blog, here were my requirements designing my blog content management system:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-decimal ml-4\">\n<li>Markdown</li>\n<li>Custom javascript</li>\n<li>Comments</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold\">Markdown</h2>\n<p>I wanted to write my blog posts in markdown to simplify things, so I opted to use <a href=\"https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown\">ReactMarkdown</a>.</p>\n<p>It lets me use markdown syntax to do things such as displaying code:</p>\n<pre><div style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background:#2b2b2b;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, &#x27;Ubuntu Mono&#x27;, monospace;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;word-wrap:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none;padding:1em;margin:0.5em 0;overflow:auto;border-radius:0.3em\"><code class=\"language-js\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background:none;font-family:Consolas, Monaco, &#x27;Andale Mono&#x27;, &#x27;Ubuntu Mono&#x27;, monospace;text-align:left;white-space:pre;word-spacing:normal;word-break:normal;word-wrap:normal;line-height:1.5;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-hyphens:none;-moz-hyphens:none;-ms-hyphens:none;hyphens:none\"><span class=\"token console class-name\">console</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#fefefe\">.</span><span class=\"token method property-access\" style=\"color:#ffd700\">log</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#fefefe\">(</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#abe338\">&quot;hello world&quot;</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#fefefe\">)</span><span class=\"token\" style=\"color:#fefefe\">;</span></code></div></pre>\n<p>This way, I don&#x27;t have to build out HTML/JSX components to write simple blog posts like this whenever I want to create a simple text post.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold\">Custom javascript</h2>\n<p>Markdown is cool and all, but really useful for just documentation, articles, text posts with no interactivity.</p>\n<p>So I decided that I wanted to incorperate javascript elements as well. This gives me the freedom to do things like this:</p><div>~ insert cool three.js example demo here ~</div><p>...while still allowing me to write most of the blog post in markdown.</p>\n<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold\">Comments</h2>\n<p>What kind of blog doesn&#x27;t allow comments? So I had to decide how to implement comments, I settled for a couple of ideas:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-disc ml-4\">\n<li>Statically-built comments</li>\n<li>Use a third-party package/library/service</li>\n<li>Write and host a backend</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the time of building this site, I wanted the whole site to be statically-generated and did not want to write a backend nor host one. I also did not want\nto use a third-party package/library/service to hold all my data (comments). Ultimately, I had to compromise (because I was lazy) and used a\n<a href=\"https://utteranc.es/\">third-party</a>.</p>\n<p>However, this wasn&#x27;t a terrible idea compared to my initial plan, which was to use GitHub issues as a way to store user comments and statically generate them\non the deployment of GitHub Pages. I could have then used a GitHub workflow to redeploy/update the comments anytime there were new comments.</p>\n<p>Utteranc.es does something similar, in that it uses GitHub issues for comments. So I decided on using this to save me time and my sanity building something like\nthat from scratch.</p>\n<h1 class=\"text-3xl font-bold\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>I didn&#x27;t really want a blog... I&#x27;m not really the best with words and have trouble with expressing my thoughts through words, especially to others.</p>\n<p>But I will try my best at documenting my life, interests, and whatnot here when I feel like I&#x27;m in the mood to write blog posts.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this terrible mess of a blog post. Bet there&#x27;s not even a dozen readers of this post ðŸ™„.</p></div>"},"documentProps":"!undefined","someAsyncProps":"!undefined"}}
